			Ninkasi Brewing Company is based in Eugene, Oregon, producing and distributing nearly 100,000 barrels of beer each year across the United States and Canada.
			Ninkasi currently tracks brewery data using digital spreadsheets, a laborious, time consuming, and error prone process.
			Quality brewing requires the company to be detail-oriented, organize its data and provide timely actions in the brewing process.
			In order to maintain good quality control in their product and give the company room to scale in its production, our team has been tasked with creating software that will improve the process of entering, storing and accessing data related to the brewing process.
			This document examines work completed on the project to this date.
			At this point in the middle of the winter term, our product has reached an alpha state and has a working interface with no database connections.
			Throughout this Progress Report, readers will see a week-by-week recount of the preparation completed for Winter term.

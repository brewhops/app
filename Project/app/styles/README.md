# Styles

This is the folder where all styling related elements go.

## Folder Structure

Folder structure is as follows:

* modules: components that will be reused amongst pages (eg. buttons, panels)
* variables: code that contains styling variables (good for holding things like color schemes)
* vendors: code that gets downloaded from other sources
